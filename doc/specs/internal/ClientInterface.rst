Client Interface
================

The client interface allows application to communicate with the RDTN daemon.
Applications do not necessarily run in a separate process, they may be
integrated with the daemon itself.

Sending and Receiving Events
----------------------------

The client interface provides applications with the capability to dispatch and
subscribe to RDTN events.
