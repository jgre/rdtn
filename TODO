Cleanup tasks:
  * Improve documentation comments (jgre)
  * More UnitTests
  * Systematic log messages (jgre)

* Error handling

Client lib: (Hannes)
  * State machine on the application side
  * Event subscriptions
  * without Event-Loop

Link:
  * try to establish links after failure

TCP CL:
  * ACKs (Hannes)
  * Keepalive (Hannes)

Bundle parser:
  * Fragmentation (v0.2)
  * Flags (jgre)
  * Custody handling (jgre)
  * Administrative records

    => Factory for state objects
  * FilePayload for Bundles (receive into files) (v0.2)

Storage: (xi)

    => do not hold payload in memory all the time
  * Meta-Infos for bundles
  * change: write each bundle in separate PStores
  * need unique file names for bundle-PStores: hash(Sender-EID, Receiver-EID, TS, fragment offset)
  * plus separate index (Meta-Info -> file name)

Routing:
  * Implement routing interface (jgre)
  * Simple Flood router (jgre) (v0.2)
  * PROPHET router


Config file (xi)
  * change syntax (Ruby hash for CL arguments instead of optstring)

* Start Daemon from apps when it is not running
* Consider replacing event loop with threads
* Implement Bundle Security
* Block-passing in generic parser (jgre)


Service-Location (0.1)
  * Bonjour?
  * Avahi?
  * DDA?


File Directory CL (0.2++)
  * receive from and write to directories (similar to Uni-DTN)
