----------------------------------------------------
This set of DieselNet traces where compiled during Spring 2007 from busses running routes serviced by UmassTransit, which lists their bus routes on the web at http://www.umass.edu/campus_services/transit/. UmassTransit's 40 busses were equipped with DieselNet equipment and a certain portion of those operated daily as dictated by bus failures and maintenance. 
 

All connection events occurring during a day are stored in the log file matching that date (month/day/year). The buses are identified by their MAC address. Time stamps are recorded as absolute minutes and seconds after midnight. In the following entry, bus 00:09:5B:B3:E3:4E sent bus 00:09:5B:B5:6E:6E at 06:57:18 transferring 94240422 bytes. The latitude and longitude of meeting is 72.53267 and 42.39381 respectively. The last column is true if the satellite reading is current and false otherwise.  

00:09:5B:B3:E3:4E 00:09:5B:B5:6E:6E 06:57:18 94240422 72.53267 42.39381 true
